# Spectral Operator

*A modular Python framework for spectral operator theory, numerical linear algebra, and scientific computing.*

---

## Overview

**Spectral Operator** is an open-source Python library providing a modular framework for constructing, analyzing, and 
experimenting with linear operators from a spectral perspective.

Originally motivated by research into operator-theoretic approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis, the library has evolved 
into a general-purpose toolkit for finite-dimensional spectral analysis, numerical operator theory, and scientific 
computing.

The project emphasizes:

* modular software architecture,
* immutable operator objects,
* rigorous mathematical abstractions,
* comprehensive unit testing,
* and extensibility for future research.

Although several modules originated from research on spectral approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis, the library is 
intentionally designed to support a much broader range of applications.
